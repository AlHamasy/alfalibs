### Adding Dependency
* To use this library, put it in your application build.gradle

```java
 repositories {
    maven {

    }
 }
```
```java

We can use this library to reduce an effort for developing android apps, This Library contains:

- Fragment and Activity navigation helped by @rebus007 library
- Navigation Slider View, helped by @vikramkakkar
- Project Lombok
- Butterknife project
- WLog, for logging your apps in general configuration, with control mode to change mode when app is in Development or Production mode, in simple words we can enable / disable logging mode
- Usable Adapter Collection e.g RecyclerAdapter, SpinnerAdapter, and so on (Explanation Later)
